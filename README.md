# SHOULD
- Follow clean code practices
- Have a github repository
# COULD
- Have a nice console interface - elements printed when the program starts
- Have a GUI - maybe Tkinter
- Have the ability to search for multiple ingredients
- Save the recipes in the file
- Order results by a specific piece of data
- Ask the user additional questions to decide which recipe they should choose
- Cross-reference the ingredient against the Edamam nutrition analysis API
- Use a different searchable API
- Show the user additional information provided by the API, e.g. calories count
- Allow for "theme" search depending on the API, e.g. movies/anime meals
